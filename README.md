# First-ComputerVisionProject

This is my first project using **Computer Vision**, built with **MediaPipe** and **OpenCV**.  
The project demonstrates **real-time hand tracking** using a webcam.

## üìÅ Files & Structure

- `Project - Basic Hand Track.py`  
  Main script that captures webcam input and uses MediaPipe to detect hand landmarks.  

- `requirements.txt`  
  Lists the dependencies and Python version needed to run the project (MediaPipe, OpenCV, NumPy).
  
## ‚úÖ Purpose

This repository serves as a starting point to:

- Learn and explore the basics of **Computer Vision**.  
- Use **MediaPipe** for hand landmark detection.  
- Use **OpenCV** for video capture, visualization, and drawing utilities.  
- Build foundational experience with **real-time vision applications**.
