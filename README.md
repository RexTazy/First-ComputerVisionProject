# First-ComputerVisionProject

This is my first project using **Computer Vision**, built with **MediaPipe** and **OpenCV**.  
The project demonstrates **real-time hand tracking** using a webcam.

## 📁 Files & Structure

- `Project - Basic Hand Track.py`  
  Main script that captures webcam input and uses MediaPipe to detect hand landmarks.  

- `requirements.txt`  
  Lists the dependencies and Python version needed to run the project (MediaPipe, OpenCV, NumPy).
  
## ✅ Purpose

This repository serves as a starting point to:

- Learn and explore the basics of **Computer Vision**.  
- Use **MediaPipe** for hand landmark detection.  
- Use **OpenCV** for video capture, visualization, and drawing utilities.  
- Build foundational experience with **real-time vision applications**.

## ⚙ Installation

1. Clone this repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RexTazy/First-ComputerVisionProject.git
   cd First-ComputerVisionProject

2. Create a virtual environment:
   
  ```bash
  python -m venv venv
  venv\Scripts\activate

3. Install dependencies:

  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Run the main script:

  ```bash
  python "Project - Basic Hand Track.py"

## 📌 Notes

- Make sure your camera permissions are enabled if using webcam.
- You can modify or extend this project (e.g. add new vision tasks like object detection).
- MediaPipe and OpenCV versions can affect behaviour; check requirements.txt for details.
